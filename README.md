# ball-game
My second project and first game in python. Python is  my first coding language and I have to say that I am in love with python.
I started learning this language around two months ago after i got free from school.
Also, this is my first time on github and I appreciate any help from anyone and hope that in exchange I can provide the same.
I don't really know what to do here I just uploaded something I created hoping for some improvements on my code.

Coming to this game, I created this with little amount of knowledge I had of python. I know that there are classes which could be used to ease a lot of things.
I am currently learning to use classes and I also tried recreating this game with Classes but was unable to do so.
If anyone is interested, please do that.

0.2 - Added extra life collecting feature, holding key button and controlling the ball easier
